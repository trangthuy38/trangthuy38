- Hello, I'm Thuy Trang
- I am currently a student majoring in International Business at Ho Chi Minh City Open University
- In addition, I am also trying to study to become a data analyst
- I like reading books, riding bicycles and learning about technology even though I'm not very knowledgeable about it
- Data is a very interesting field, but understanding it is not easy. I hope to meet an experienced mentor and learn from them to improve myself.
